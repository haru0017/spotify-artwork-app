## What is Sav ?

[Sav](https://spotify-artwork-app.vercel.app/) is spotify artwork viewer inspired by itunes artwork screensaver. 

It is a web app, it works on any device, but it is currently optimized for 1920 * 1080 displays. Therefore, I recommend viewing this web app on your computer, not your smartphone.

## Get started

You can get started by opening a [web page](https://spotify-artwork-app.vercel.app/), entering a playlist link in the text box and pressing the "get started".

Playlist links can be easily obtained from playlist sharing operations such as the spotify app. Without link, global top 50 playlists will show. An example is the image below
